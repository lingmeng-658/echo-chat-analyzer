"""Own one bounded, single-flight shutdown protocol for the desktop process.

The window has to disappear the instant the user closes it, but the process
still owns transient Direct DB plaintext and the QQ runtime process tree Echo
launched.  A bare daemon thread cannot carry that responsibility: CPython never
joins daemon threads, so interpreter finalization froze the cleanup mid-flight
and the owned process tree survived.

This module closes that gap with one small protocol object:

* :meth:`ShutdownProtocol.begin` starts the owner callable on exactly one
  daemon thread, and every later call is ignored, so a repeated close can never
  start a second, competing cleanup;
* the protocol is bounded - callers pass their window to
  :meth:`ShutdownProtocol.wait`, which records a timeout instead of raising -
  so a stuck cleanup can never hold the process exit;
* the desktop entry point waits on this object, not on interpreter teardown,
  before the process is allowed to leave.
