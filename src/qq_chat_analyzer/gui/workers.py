"""Background execution for facade calls.

Every facade call is potentially slow: listing WeChat sessions touches an
external CLI, and analysis walks the whole message set. Running those on the
Qt main thread would freeze the window, so this module moves them onto a
worker thread and reports back through signals.

The worker knows nothing about analysis. It runs a callable, then emits either
the result or a :class:`FacadeError`. That keeps every decision about *what*
to run on the page, and every decision about *how* to report failure in one
place.
