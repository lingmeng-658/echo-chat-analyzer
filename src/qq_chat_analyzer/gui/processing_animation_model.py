"""Deterministic state and timing model for the Echo processing animation.

This is the testable half of the accepted Astra book prototype
(``output/processing-book-prototype/dist/index.html``): the phase timeline, the
paper bookkeeping and the transition relations the prototype's ``T`` table and
``tick`` functions define, with the drawing removed.  A later QPainter caller
reads state from here and renders it.

Deliberate boundaries:

* Time is external.  :meth:`ProcessingAnimationModel.advance` is the only input
  that moves state, so a GUI timer and a test drive the same timeline, and no
  test needs a real clock.
* The milliseconds in :class:`AnimationTiming` are visual gesture lengths taken
  from the prototype.  They are never task durations and never describe the
  progress of the real analysis work.
* Geometry stays outside this model.  The twelve control points, the Coons
  surface interpolation for paper text, the pen silhouette and the ink
  arc-length walk are Stage 2B work and are deliberately not ported here.
* Phase events come from the application layer's
  :class:`~qq_chat_analyzer.application.analysis_phase.AnalysisPhase`, so the
  model never invents a second vocabulary for the same two stages.
