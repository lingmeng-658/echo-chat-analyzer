"""The single bridge credential of the runtime Echo launched.

Echo owns at most one NapCat runtime per process (one fixed bridge port, one
launch serialized by the auth bridge), so exactly one credential exists at a
time. The launcher mints a fresh value for each launch. Cached status/metadata
providers follow the current session; snapshot clients retain one launch's
credential across acquire, retries and cleanup. Stopping the owned tree or
observing its exit retires the credential.

The value never reaches the repository, a configuration file, a log line or a
report.  It travels only through the launched child's private environment block
and a request header. Each bridge accepts only the credential of its launch.
